# DOM Events
Client-side JavaScript programs use an asynchronous event-driven programming model.
In this style of programming, the web browser generates an event whenever something interesting happens
to the document or browser or to some element or object associated with it.
The event type is a string that specifies what kind of event occurred.

5. Mouseenter. The event occurs when the pointer is moved onto an element
